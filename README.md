**Category**                                         **Tools & Technologies**

Data Source & Extraction	                  CSV, Excel (initial cleanup)

Data Modeling & Analysis	                 Power BI Desktop, Power Query (M Language), DAX                                                 (Data Analysis Expressions)

Data Processing & ETL	                      Power Query transformations (Data Type Conversion,                                               Column Management, Time Intelligence)

Visualization & Reporting	                  Power BI Visuals (Card, Table, Matrix, Line/Area                                                 Charts, Slicers), Custom Visual Design

Financial Concepts	                         Asset Weighting, Returns Calculation, Volatility                                               (Standard Deviation), Covariance, Risk/Return                                                  Analysis

## **Key Processes Implemented**

**1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** Imported raw portfolio data (Risk_Management_Portfolio_Data.csv) and applied comprehensive cleaning steps in Power Query, ensuring data quality, correct column types (e.g., Date, Numeric), and consistent formatting.

**2. Data Modeling & Relationships:** Established a star-schema-like model within Power BI, defining calculated columns and measures crucial for financial analysis.

**3. DAX Measure Creation:** Developed core analytical measures using DAX, including Weighted Portfolio Return, Aggregate Volatility, and Total Portfolio Covariance to quantify risk and performance.

**4. Interactive Dashboard Design:** Structured the Power BI report with dedicated pages for Performance Overview, Risk Metrics, and Asset Deep Dive, incorporating responsive design and drill-through capabilities.

**5. Risk Communication:** Visualized asset-specific and portfolio-level risk metrics (Volatility, Covariance vs. S&P 500) to clearly identify and communicate potential risk exposure to stakeholders.
